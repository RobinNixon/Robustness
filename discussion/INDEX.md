## Highlights

### Design Principles
- **Segregate Computation and Persistence** — The "compute briefly, crystallize" pattern
- **Match Sampling to Carrier Period** — Avoid anti-resonance in monitoring systems
- **Build on Basins** — Design for repair, not just stability
- **Pre-Screen Substrates** — Leakiness and capacity as predictors

### Biological Implications
- Homeostasis as basin behavior
- Circadian rhythms as limit cycles
- Developmental canalization as basin geometry
- Prediction: biological computation segregated from persistence

### Open Problems
- Formal proof of axis independence
- Extension to continuous dynamical systems
- Identification of additional orthogonal axes
- Quantum systems and the framework

### FAQ Highlights
- "Isn't orthogonal just correlation?" — Clarification of terminology
- "This is limited to cellular automata" — Generalization arguments
- "Hidden state is obvious" — Distinction from generic "memory"
- "What's the practical value?" — Engineering applications
