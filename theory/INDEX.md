# Theory Documents Index

This directory contains the formal theoretical development of the Orthogonal Robustness Framework.

## Core Documents

### 1. FOUR_AXES.md
Definition and criteria for the four orthogonal axes:
- Computational Capability (Paper 1)
- Self-Maintenance (Papers 2-4)
- Survival (Paper 5)
- Visibility (Paper 6)

### 2. ORTHOGONALITY_PROOFS.md
Evidence for axis independence:
- Computation ⊥ Self-Maintenance
- Survival ⊥ Visibility
- Computation ⊥ Survival
- Cross-paper evidence compilation

### 3. HIDDEN_STATE_UNIFIER.md
Hidden state as the universal enabler:
- Role in each axis
- The stickiness mechanism
- Physical analogues
- Synthesis Claim 1

### 4. BASIN_ORGANIZER.md
Basin of attraction as organizing principle:
- Role in self-maintenance
- Role in survival
- Role in visibility
- Why computation is the exception
- Synthesis Claim 2

## Key Theorems

| Theorem | File | Statement |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Orthogonal Robustness | FOUR_AXES | Four independent axes characterize robustness |
| Computation ⊥ Self-Maintenance | ORTHOGONALITY_PROOFS | Rule 110 computes but is not life-like |
| Survival ⊥ Visibility | ORTHOGONALITY_PROOFS | Basin strength and phase alignment are independent |
| Intrinsicality | BASIN_ORGANIZER | Basins are non-transferable |
| Hidden State Necessity | HIDDEN_STATE_UNIFIER | All four axes require hidden state |

## Reading Order

For newcomers:
1. Start with FOUR_AXES.md for the basic framework
2. Read ORTHOGONALITY_PROOFS.md for evidence
3. Read HIDDEN_STATE_UNIFIER.md and BASIN_ORGANIZER.md for synthesis

For experts:
1. Jump to ORTHOGONALITY_PROOFS.md for the formal independence arguments
2. Check BASIN_ORGANIZER.md for the computation-robustness tradeoff
